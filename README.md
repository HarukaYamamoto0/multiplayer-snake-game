## About The Project

![Screen Shot](./images/screenshot.png)

This is a simple game I created based on Felipe Dechamps' [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMdYygf53DP5SVQQrkKCVWDS0TwYLVitL). I built it for a festival at my school so that people could play and enjoy it. While it's not perfect, the game is fully functional. If you're playing on a mobile device, just swipe in the direction you want the snake to move.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Primary programming language.
- **HTML**: Structure for the UI.
- **CSS**: Styling the game.
- **Socket.io**: Manages real-time data exchange.
- **Express**: Server framework.

## üîß How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HarukaYamamoto0/multiplayer-snake-game.git
    ```
2. Open it in Visual Studio Code:
   ```bash
   code ./multiplayer-snake-game
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
5. Access the game at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## üìö What I Learned

- How to use `Socket.io` to implement real-time communication between multiple players.
- The importance of writing efficient and clean code for managing game state.
- How to set up and use `Express` to create a simple server to host the game.
- Integrating front-end and back-end to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
